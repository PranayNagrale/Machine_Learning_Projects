# Decision Tree Regressor

In this data, we have one indepenedent variable 'Temperature' and one depenedent variable 'Revenue'. You have to build a Decision Tree Regressor to study the relationship b/w the two variables of the ICE CREAM shop and then predict the revenue for the ICE CREAM shop based on the temperature on a particular day.

* What is Decision Tree?
A decision tree is one of the most powerful tools of supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. It is constructed by recursively splitting the training data into subsets based on the values of the attributes until a stopping criterion is met, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples required to split a node.
During training, the Decision Tree algorithm selects the best attribute to split the data based on a metric such as entropy or Gini impurity, which measures the level of impurity or randomness in the subsets. The goal is to find the attribute that maximizes the information gain or the reduction in impurity after the split.
